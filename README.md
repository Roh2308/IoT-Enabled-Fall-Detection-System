# IoT-Enabled-Fall-Detection-System
This project focusses on creating a smart, real-time fall detection system to improve the safety of older people.  The system uses an Arduino-based setup with motion (MPU6050), pressure (BMP280), and distance (HC-SR04) sensors to track unexpected changes in movement, posture, and altitude.  To correctly identify falls while minimising false alarms, machine learning models such as Random Forest and XGBoost are applied to the collected data.  When the technology detects a fall, it immediately sends notifications to carers, assuring quick assistance.  The system is inexpensive, scalable, and designed to be both wearable and non-intrusive, increasing geriatric independence and safety.
